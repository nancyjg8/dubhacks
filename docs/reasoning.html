                Time your studying with our website Grow With Us! Between 1 hour intervals of concentrating studying
                comes a relaxing 20 minutes animation of a growing plant.
                Research shows that a relaxing break, anywhere between 15-20 minutes can increase
                productivity by letting your brain disengage without fully losing momentum of your work.
                For most, the brain is only able to truly focus for about an hour before needing a
                break.
